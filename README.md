# Lingo
## Abstract
This is a SPA version of the dutch television game Lingo. It is translated into three languages and offers own sets of words for each.

## Technologies
 - React
 - Enzyme
 - Express
 - Bootstrap

## Set Up
Until now you would need a server that serves five letter words to the application. (I will upload mine soon)

To install use `npm install` to install the needed npm modules.

To start use `npm start` and a browser window will open with the application.

To run the tests use `npm test`.

## Kudos
This project is built with create-react-app. Also it is based on test driven development practices taught by Bonnie Schulkin.
